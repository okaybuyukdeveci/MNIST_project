# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition Project
This project uses the MNIST dataset to train a deep learning model for recognizing handwritten digits (0-9). The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and can predict the digit from an image input.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a neural network that can recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained on 60,000 images of digits and tested on 10,000 images. After training, the model can be used to predict digits in new images.
